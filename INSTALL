You can install Emacs-IDE:

- either for all users(as root):
  Execute "./install -r" (with root privileges) in a terminal.

- or for current user only:
  Execute "./install -l" or just "./install" in a terminal.

At the end of installation, instructions are given for enabling Emacs-IDE in
your ~/.emacs.

Emacs-IDE can be uninstalled using "./uninstall" command (with -l option if it
was installed for current user only).
Instructions are given for removing Emacs-IDE from your ~/.emacs as well.
